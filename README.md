# redux-catalyst-multiselect

A Redux-based MultiSelect component, in ES6, with filtering

MultiSelectPicker is a simple, multi-select control with search filtering, storing all its state in the Redux store.
Pass in props of availableOptions to populate the 'from' (available options) side of the multiselect, and initialOptions for the 'to' (picked options) side.

### TODO:
* Make CSS more configurable
* Allow to turn on/off filters
* Fix issue with more than 1 select not getting moved over
* Implement initiallyPicked list functionality
* Allow arrow buttons to have configurable labels
